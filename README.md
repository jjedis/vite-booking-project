🗓️ Massage Booking Calendar – Project Overview

This project is a responsive web-app for booking a massage.
It allows users to:

- View available times

- Select a service duration and type

- Choose a date within the next four weeks

- Choose an available time

- View different layouts for mobile and desktop

🔐 Planned Backend Features

The backend will be implemented once the frontend is stable. Planned features include:

- User authentication (login, account creation, role handling)

- SQL database for securely storing:

  - Customer information

  - Booking history

  - Service configurations

- API endpoints for managing bookings and availability

- Secure communication between frontend and backend

The calendar interface is fully responsive, using a mobile-optimized grid layout and a more detailed desktop layout with inline time selection.

🧩 Tech Stack

- React (TypeScript)

- CSS for layout and animation

- Bootstrap for components

- Motion.dev for animation and swipe-support

- Node.js for server side ( not done )

🕓 Project Status

This project is not urgent and is being developed whenever time allows. The point of the project is to gain experience and learn new technologies i have not used or i`m not very experienced in (React and node mostly).
Features and styling are added step-by-step as needed.

⭐ Current Goals

- Improve UI consistency between mobile and desktop

- Expand time availability logic

- Finish the frontend so backend work can begin
